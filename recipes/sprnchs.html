        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            
                <ol>1 pound ground beef</ol>
                <ol>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</ol>
                <ol>Â¾ cup water</ol>
                <ol>1 (18 ounce) package restaurant-style tortilla chips</ol>
                <ol>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</ol>
                <ol>1 (15.5 ounce) can refried beans</ol>
                <ol>1 cup salsa</ol>
                <ol>1 cup sour cream, or more to taste</ol>
                <ol>1 (10 ounce) can pitted black olives, drained and chopped</ol>
                <ol>4 green onions, diced</ol>
                <ol>1 (4 ounce) can sliced jalapeno peppers, drained</ol>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            
                <ol>1. Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning mix and water and simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. </ol>
                <ol>2. Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</ol>
                <ol>3. Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet; top with Cheddar cheese and dot with refried beans and ground beef mixture.</ol>
                <ol>4. Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, watching carefully to prevent burning, 3 to 5 minutes.</ol>
                <ol>5. Top nachos with salsa, sour cream, black olives, green onions, and jalapeno peppers.</ol>
