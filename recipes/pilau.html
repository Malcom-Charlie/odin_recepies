                <ol>2 tbsp Cumin seeds</ol>
                <ol>1 Stick cinnamon</ol>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

                <h4>Pilau Masala</h4>

                <ol>1. Place the cumin, coriander, black peppers, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves in a dry pan.</ol>
                <ol>2. Roast over low heat until warmed through and fragrant and blend (I used a coffee grinder) until smooth.</ol>
                <ol>3. You need just 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons for this recipe (depending on how fragrant you want the rice to be). Feel free to store the leftover spice powder in an airtight container for up to 3 months, or refrigerate for up to 6 months.</ol>
                
                <h4>Rice Pilau</h4>

                <ol>1. Heat a stockpot on medium-high heat. Add oil and heat until hot but not smoking.</ol>
                <ol>2. Add the sliced onions and fry for 10-15 minutes or till the onions starts to turn golden brown (be careful not to burn it).</ol>
                <ol>3. Add the garlic, ginger, serrano pepper, Cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</ol>
                <ol>4. Add the cubed beef, pilau masala, beef stock cubes, bay leaves, cilantro, and salt to taste. Cook until the meat browns and caramelizes stirring occasionally about 8 to 10 minutes.</ol>
                <ol>5. Add the diced tomatoes and cook for 4-5 minutes, until the tomatoes have released their liquid.</ol>
                <ol>6. Stir in the potatoes and the water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes.</ol>
                <ol>7. Stir in the rice, and cover tightly with a foil paper (to keep the steam in) if necessary. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</ol>
                <ol>8. Once the rice is dry, remove the foil paper and fluff with a fork to ensure the seasonings are well distributed all around the rice.</ol>
                <ol>9. Serve hot with fresh Kachumbari. Enjoy!</ol>
